\# Power in Arkansas

Political outcomes in Arkansas are rarely accidental.

They are produced by \*\*structures\*\*, \*\*procedures\*\*, and \*\*relationships\*\* that determine:

\- who gets to decide,

\- whose decisions matter,

\- and how resistance is managed.

This section explains how power operates in Arkansas â€” not through personalities alone, but through systems that persist across generations.

These frameworks are designed to help readers interpret constitutions, laws, elections, court decisions, and community outcomes with clarity.

\## Core Power Channels

Power in Arkansas operates primarily through six interlocking channels:

1\. \*\*Rules\*\* â€” constitutions, statutes, and procedures

2\. \*\*Gatekeepers\*\* â€” committees, offices, and appointment power

3\. \*\*Money\*\* â€” funding, contracts, and economic leverage

4\. \*\*Courts\*\* â€” interpretation, enforcement, and delay

5\. \*\*Geography\*\* â€” districts, boundaries, and representation

6\. \*\*Narrative\*\* â€” legitimacy, fear, and public consent

Each channel is documented below, with historical context and modern examples.

\## How to Use This Section

\- Start with the framework pages to understand structure.

\- Then return to the timeline, constitutions, and events.

\- Ask: \*Which power channels are operating here?\*

This section does not argue outcomes.

It explains mechanisms.

Understanding mechanisms is how accountability begins.
