# Gatekeepers and Choke Points

Power in Arkansas is often exercised by **those who control access**, not those who cast final votes.

Gatekeepers decide:

- which bills are heard,
- which amendments advance,
- which voices are amplified or ignored.

---

## Committees as Control Points

Legislative committees function as:

- filters,
- delay mechanisms,
- and quiet veto points.

A bill that never receives a hearing never requires opposition.

---

## Appointments and Boards

Boards, commissions, and agencies often:

- operate outside public view,
- control licensing, contracts, and enforcement,
- shape outcomes without elections.

Appointment power is long-term power.

---

## Why This Matters

Gatekeeping allows power to be exercised without visibility.

It creates:

- plausible deniability,
- procedural legitimacy,
- and minimal accountability.

Understanding who controls access explains why some ideas never surface.
