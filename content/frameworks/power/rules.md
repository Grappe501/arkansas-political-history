\# Rules as Power

In Arkansas, power most often operates through \*\*rules\*\*, not force.

Rules determine:

\- who can act,

\- how decisions are made,

\- and how change can occur â€” or be blocked.

---

\## Constitutions as Power Architecture

Constitutions define:

\- which branches dominate,

\- how authority is fragmented or concentrated,

\- and how difficult reform will be.

Arkansasâ€™ 1874 Constitution was explicitly designed to:

\- weaken executive enforcement,

\- empower the legislature,

\- and resist future reform.

This design continues to shape governance today.

\## Procedure Over Substance

Many political battles in Arkansas are won before debate begins.

Examples include:

\- committee referral rules,

\- amendment thresholds,

\- ballot access requirements,

\- and timing constraints.

When procedure controls outcomes, power hides in process.

\## Why This Matters

Rules appear neutral.

But they encode priorities.

Understanding Arkansas politics requires asking:

\- \*Who wrote the rules?\*

\- \*Who benefits from them?\*

\- \*Who struggles to navigate them?\*
