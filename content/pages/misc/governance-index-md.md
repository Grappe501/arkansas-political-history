\# Governance & Stewardship

This archive exists to serve the public.

Its credibility depends not only on sources, but on \*\*how decisions about inclusion, interpretation, and revision are made\*\*.

This page explains:

\- who may contribute,

\- who curates and reviews content,

\- how disagreement is handled,

\- and how the archive remains accountable over time.

Governance is not an afterthought.

It is part of the evidence.
