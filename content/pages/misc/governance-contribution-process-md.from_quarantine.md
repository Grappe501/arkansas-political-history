\# How Contributions Are Handled

All contributions follow a documented process.

---

\## Step 1: Submission

Submissions may include:

\- source materials

\- suggested edits

\- new page proposals

\- corrections or challenges

Each submission must include:

\- contributor identification

\- source citation

\- explanation of relevance

---

\## Step 2: Review

Editorial stewards:

\- verify sources,

\- assess relevance,

\- identify conflicts or gaps,

\- classify claims vs. interpretation.

---

\## Step 3: Decision

Outcomes may include:

\- acceptance and publication,

\- request for clarification,

\- partial incorporation,

\- or rejection with explanation.

All decisions are documented internally.

---

\## Step 4: Publication or Update

Approved contributions are:

\- added additively,

\- tagged appropriately,

\- versioned when necessary.

Nothing is silently changed.
