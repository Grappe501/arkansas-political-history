\# Procedural Supremacy

\## Definition

Procedural supremacy occurs when control over \*process\* determines outcomes more than debate over substance.

Power is exercised by deciding:

\- who may participate,

\- when decisions are considered,

\- and how rules are interpreted.

---

\## Why It Matters

Procedural control allows power to:

\- appear neutral,

\- avoid public accountability,

\- and operate without overt exclusion.

Outcomes can be predetermined before discussion begins.

---

\## Arkansas Context

Procedural supremacy is visible in:

\- committee gatekeeping,

\- amendment access restrictions,

\- ballot initiative rules,

\- and legislative scheduling practices.

It is a defining feature of modern Arkansas governance.
