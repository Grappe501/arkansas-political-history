# Search Filters — Language Spec

This document defines consistent user-facing language for search and filtering.

The goal is clarity without jargon.

---

## Search Bar

### Placeholder text
“Search constitutions, events, eras, places, and power mechanisms…”

### Helper text (optional)
“Try: ‘1874’, ‘preemption’, ‘initiative’, ‘Phillips County’, ‘at-large’”

### Empty state (no query)
“Start typing to search the archive.”

---

## Filter Group Labels

- Content Type
- Era
- Power Channel
- Power Mechanism
- Policy Area
- Place
- Date Range (Events)

---

## Default Option Labels

- “All” (for content type)
- “Any era”
- “Any channel”
- “Any mechanism”
- “Any policy area”
- “Any place”
- “Any time”

---

## Results Header Language

### With query
“Results for: ‘{query}’”

### With filters only
“Results matching selected filters”

### With query + filters
“Results for: ‘{query}’ (filtered)”

---

## Empty Results States

### No results
“No matches found.”

### Suggestions line
“Try a broader term, remove filters, or explore by era.”

### Optional quick links
- Explore the Constitution
- Explore the Timeline
- Browse Power Mechanisms

---

## Result Card Fields (consistent labels)

- Era: {era}
- Date: {date}
- Status: Draft / Active / Template
- Tags: {tags}

---

## Clickable Tag Label
“View all pages tagged: {tag}”

---

## Sourcing Status Language (standard)

- “Sources pending”
- “Partially sourced”
- “Fully sourced”

Avoid:
- “verified”
- “truth”
- “proven”

We use sourcing transparency, not absolutism.
