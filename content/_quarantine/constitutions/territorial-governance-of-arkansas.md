# Territorial Governance of Arkansas (1803–1836)

## Overview

Before Arkansas became a state, it was governed as a U.S. territory. This period established many of the power dynamics that would later be embedded in the 1836 Constitution.

Territorial governance was not democratic in the modern sense. Authority flowed downward from the federal government, not upward from residents.
