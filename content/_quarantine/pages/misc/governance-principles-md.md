\# Governing Principles

All contributors and stewards of this archive operate under the following principles:

---

\## 1. Public Accountability

This archive exists for the public, not for private, partisan, or commercial interests.

Decisions must be explainable and documented.

---

\## 2. Evidence First

Claims must be tied to sources.

Interpretations must be labeled.

Disagreement is handled through documentation, not suppression.

---

\## 3. Additive History

Content is added, contextualized, and revised â€” not erased.

Earlier interpretations remain visible unless demonstrably incorrect.

---

\## 4. Power Awareness

Historical records reflect power.

This archive actively examines who created sources and who was excluded.

---

\## 5. Institutional Humility

No individual or organization owns historical truth.

Standards matter more than authority.
