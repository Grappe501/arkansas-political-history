Stand Up Arkansas — The People’s Political History

## 1. Purpose of This Document
This document defines how content is written, structured, tagged, and maintained across the archive.
Its goals are to ensure:
consistency across hundreds (eventually thousands) of pages,
clarity for readers,
auditability for researchers,
and durability as contributors change.
These standards apply to all content, regardless of author or topic.

## 2. Content Philosophy
### Civic Archive with Moral Clarity
This archive:
does not pretend neutrality where power is evident,
does not advocate policy positions,
does not editorialize without evidence.
It does:
document structures of power,
label interpretation clearly,
preserve contested history without erasure,
and prioritize public accountability.
Tone is calm, precise, and serious.

## 3. Required Frontmatter (ALL PAGES)
Every Markdown page must include frontmatter.

Present-day advocacy language

## 6. Claims vs. Interpretation
### Claims
Must be specific
Must be testable
Must be sourceable
### Interpretation
Must be labeled as interpretation
Must be grounded in claims
May coexist with competing interpretations
Never blur the two.

## 7. Sources & Citations
Every page must include a Sources section.
“Sources pending” is acceptable for drafts.
Cite primary sources where possible.
Secondary sources must be identified as such.
Conflicting sources must be acknowledged.

## 8. Tagging Standards
Use only approved tag vocabularies.
Every substantive page should include at least:
one era (if applicable),
one power_channel or power_mechanism.
Tags are analytical, not decorative.

## 9. Versioning & Updates
Pages must display status and last updated date (handled in UI).
Significant changes require additive updates.
Do not silently rewrite historical interpretation.

## 10. What This Archive Is Not
Not a campaign site
Not a blog
Not an opinion column
Not a neutral-by-default encyclopedia
It is a public civic record with standards.

## 11. Enforcement
Editorial Stewards are responsible for enforcing these standards.
Pages that do not meet standards remain in draft status.
Repeated violations may result in contributor review.
Standards protect credibility.

## 12. Final Note
These standards are not meant to restrict truth —
they exist to protect it from distortion, drift, and decay.
If this document is followed, the archive will remain coherent and trusted for decades.
