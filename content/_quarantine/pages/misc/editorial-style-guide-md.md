# Editorial Style Guide
Stand Up Arkansas — The People’s Political History

## Purpose
Prevent tone drift across contributors while preserving moral clarity.

---

## Voice
- Calm
- Serious
- Precise
- Non-performative

We document structure and consequence.

---

## Preferred language patterns
- “This structure had the effect of…”
- “Enforcement varied by…”
- “Records indicate…”
- “This change increased/decreased the ability to…”

---

## Avoid
- sarcasm
- rhetorical questions
- labels like “evil,” “corrupt,” “traitor” without evidence
- contemporary partisan framing

---

## Claims vs Interpretations
- Put factual claims in declarative sentences.
- Label interpretation with a lead-in:
- “Interpretation: …”
- “Power analysis: …”
- “One reading of the record suggests…”

---

## Discussing harm
- Be direct, not sensational.
- Prefer: “disenfranchised,” “excluded,” “coerced,” “suppressed”
- Avoid graphic language unless necessary and sourced.

---

## Section discipline
Use standard headings and keep pages scannable.
White space is part of credibility.
