# Arkansas Political History Project
## Daily Build Log — 2025-03-26

### 1. What We Worked On Today
Established the foundational direction for the Arkansas Political History Project.
Defined the project as a long-term, evidence-based historical system rather than a traditional website.
Outlined a modular architecture prioritizing provenance, claims-based knowledge, and additive history.
Decided to build an externalized “Brain of the Build” using versioned markdown files as the project’s cognitive memory.

### 2. New Decisions Made
- Decision: Build a markdown-based external memory system for the entire project.
- Rationale: Prevent loss of institutional memory, enable transparent evolution of ideas, and support long-term historical integrity.
- Implications: All future work must be documented daily and logged additively.
- Affected Modules: Entire project.
- Confidence Level: High.

### 3. New Concepts / Frameworks Introduced
- “Brain of the Build”: A living, versioned markdown archive serving as the project’s cognitive system.
- Additive cognition: New understanding accumulates without erasing prior thinking.
- Claims-based history as the core organizing principle.

### 4. Changes to Prior Thinking
This formalized earlier discussions into a strict, versioned documentation system rather than ad hoc notes.

### 5. Open Questions Identified
- How granular community impact data should be at the earliest historical periods.
- How to best represent Indigenous governance prior to statehood within a claims-based framework.

### 6. Risks / Watchouts
- Risk of documentation fatigue if daily logs are skipped.
- Risk of overconfidence in early structural assumptions without sufficient historical testing.

### 7. Action Items for Next Session
- Begin defining historical eras and periodization for Arkansas.
- Start the Constitution module with territorial governance and the 1836 Constitution.
- Create initial provenance and claims model documentation.

### 8. Source Notes
No primary sources ingested today; structural and conceptual work only.

### 9. Meta Notes
This day establishes the intellectual scaffolding for the entire project. Getting this right early prevents systemic failure later.
