\# Design Principles â€” Stand Up Arkansas Civic Archive

\## 1. Authority Through Clarity

Design should slow the reader down, not overwhelm them.

\## 2. Permanence Over Trend

This should feel archival, not fashionable.

\## 3. Structure Over Decoration

Hierarchy, spacing, and typography do the work â€” not icons.

\## 4. Accessibility Without Dilution

Plain language, serious tone.

\## 5. Accountability by Design

Dates, versions, sources, and updates are always visible.

\## 6. No Gimmicks

No gamification.

No rage bait.

No aesthetic noise.
