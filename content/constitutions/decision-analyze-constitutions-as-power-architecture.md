\# Decision: Analyze Constitutions as Power Architecture

\## Date

2025-03-28

\## Context

Traditional constitutional histories often treat constitutions as neutral legal texts rather than instruments of power.

\## Decision

Frame every Arkansas constitution as a designed power architecture reflecting the interests and exclusions of its drafters.

\## Alternatives Considered

\- Pure legalistic analysis (rejected)

\- Timeline-only summaries (rejected)

\## Consequences

\- Enables clearer understanding of who benefited and who was harmed.

\- Requires careful sourcing and contextual framing.

\## Revisit Conditions

If future research suggests a different analytical lens better explains outcomes.
