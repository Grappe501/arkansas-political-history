# Decision: Analyze Constitutions as Power Architecture

## Date
2025-03-28

## Context
Traditional constitutional histories often treat constitutions as neutral legal texts rather than instruments of power.

## Decision
Frame every Arkansas constitution as a designed power architecture reflecting the interests and exclusions of its drafters.

## Alternatives Considered
- Pure legalistic analysis (rejected)
- Timeline-only summaries (rejected)

## Consequences
- Enables clearer understanding of who benefited and who was harmed.
- Requires careful sourcing and contextual framing.

## Revisit Conditions
If future research suggests a different analytical lens better explains outcomes.
