# Decision: Treat the Amendment Process as a Power Structure

## Date
2025-04-02

## Context
Arkansas constitutional change since 1874 occurs almost exclusively through amendments rather than full rewrites.

## Decision
Analyze the amendment process itself as a core mechanism of political power and control.

## Alternatives Considered
- Treat amendments as neutral procedural tools (rejected)
- Focus only on amendment content (rejected)

## Consequences
- Shifts analysis toward access, gatekeeping, and enforcement.
- Enables clearer understanding of modern reform failures.

## Revisit Conditions
If future evidence suggests procedural neutrality rather than strategic containment.
