# Decision: Classify the 1861 Constitution as a Failure-State Constitution

## Date
2025-03-29

## Context
The 1861 Constitution was adopted during secession and civil war, raising questions about legitimacy and function.

## Decision
Define the 1861 Constitution as a failure-state constitution: a document produced to preserve elite control amid collapsing institutions.

## Alternatives Considered
- Treat as standard constitutional revision (rejected)
- Treat as purely symbolic (rejected)

## Consequences
- Centers analysis on power preservation rather than reform.
- Requires careful distinction between legal text and practical governance.

## Revisit Conditions
If evidence suggests broader democratic intent or sustained functional governance under the 1861 framework.
