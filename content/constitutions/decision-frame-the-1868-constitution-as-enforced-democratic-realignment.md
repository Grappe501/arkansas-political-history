\# Decision: Frame the 1868 Constitution as Enforced Democratic Realignment

\## Date

2025-03-31

\## Context

The 1868 Constitution introduced the most expansive democratic reforms in Arkansas history under federal oversight.

\## Decision

Analyze the 1868 Constitution as an externally enforced realignment of political power rather than an internal reform movement.

\## Alternatives Considered

\- Treat as organic democratic evolution (rejected)

\- Treat as illegitimate imposition (rejected)

\## Consequences

\- Centers analysis on enforcement, resistance, and backlash.

\- Prevents victim-blaming narratives about Reconstruction failure.

\## Revisit Conditions

If future evidence suggests broader internal support than currently documented.
