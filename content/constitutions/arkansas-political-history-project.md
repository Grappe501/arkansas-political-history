# Arkansas Political History Project
## Daily Build Log — 2025-04-01

### 1. What We Worked On Today
Documented the Arkansas Constitution of 1874.
Analyzed it as a deliberate rollback of Reconstruction and a long-term power entrenchment mechanism.
Connected constitutional design choices to modern governance dynamics.

### 2. New Decisions Made
- Decision: Treat the 1874 Constitution as a counter-revolutionary document.
- Rationale: Its structures were explicitly designed to undo Reconstruction gains and block future reform.
- Implications: Modern Arkansas politics must be analyzed through the lens of 1874 structural constraints.
- Affected Modules: Constitution, legislature, executive power, amendment analysis.
- Confidence Level: Very High.

### 3. New Concepts / Frameworks Introduced
- “Structural counter-revolution.”
- Procedural power as a substitute for overt exclusion.
- Weak executive as an intentional governance strategy.

### 4. Changes to Prior Thinking
Clarified that many modern governance frustrations are not accidental but constitutionally engineered.

### 5. Open Questions Identified
- Which amendment rules have most effectively blocked reform?
- How often “local control” rhetoric masked elite consolidation.

### 6. Risks / Watchouts
- Risk of modern readers assuming dysfunction is accidental.
- Need to clearly distinguish constitutional structure from later statutory abuse.

### 7. Action Items for Next Session
- Begin Amendment Era analysis (1874–present).
- Map amendment attempts that succeeded vs. failed.
- Identify recurring reform choke points.

### 8. Source Notes
Primary sources to be added: 1874 constitutional text, convention debates, Brooks–Baxter War records.

### 9. Meta Notes
This session completes the core constitutional arc. Everything after this is struggle within a locked system.
