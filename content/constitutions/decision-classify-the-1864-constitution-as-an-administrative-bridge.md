# Decision: Classify the 1864 Constitution as an Administrative Bridge

## Date
2025-03-30

## Context
The 1864 Constitution was adopted during wartime under Union occupation and did not fully resolve questions of citizenship or equality.

## Decision
Define the 1864 Constitution as an administrative bridge between Confederate collapse and formal Reconstruction.

## Alternatives Considered
- Treat as full Reconstruction constitution (rejected)
- Treat as illegitimate or symbolic only (rejected)

## Consequences
- Allows nuanced analysis of incremental change.
- Prevents conflation of abolition with political inclusion.

## Revisit Conditions
If evidence shows broader enfranchisement or stronger institutional durability than currently understood.
