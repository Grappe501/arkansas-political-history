# Decision: Frame the 1868 Constitution as Enforced Democratic Realignment

## Date
2025-03-31

## Context
The 1868 Constitution introduced the most expansive democratic reforms in Arkansas history under federal oversight.

## Decision
Analyze the 1868 Constitution as an externally enforced realignment of political power rather than an internal reform movement.

## Alternatives Considered
- Treat as organic democratic evolution (rejected)
- Treat as illegitimate imposition (rejected)

## Consequences
- Centers analysis on enforcement, resistance, and backlash.
- Prevents victim-blaming narratives about Reconstruction failure.

## Revisit Conditions
If future evidence suggests broader internal support than currently documented.
