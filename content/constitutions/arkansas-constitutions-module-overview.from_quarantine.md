# Arkansas Constitutions - Module Overview

## Purpose of This Module

This module documents the full constitutional history of Arkansas, including:

- pre-statehood territorial governance,
- every constitutional convention and constitution,
- amendments and revisions,
- interpretations by courts and officials,
- and the real-world effects of constitutional structures on power and communities.

The Arkansas Constitution is treated not as a static document, but as:

- a contested political artifact,
- a tool of power,
- and a reflection of who was allowed to govern and who was excluded.

---

## Guiding Questions

- Who wrote each constitution, and under what conditions?
- Who was allowed to participate, vote, or hold office?
- What problems was each constitution trying to solve?
- What power structures did each constitution entrench or dismantle?
- How were race, class, land, labor, and citizenship encoded into governance?

- traceable to source documents,
- and mapped to the power it enables or restricts.

Interpretations and critiques must be clearly labeled as such.
