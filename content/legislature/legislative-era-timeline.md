# Arkansas Legislative Eras and Power Shifts  
## Major Acts, Structural Change, and Citizen Power

---

## How to Read This Timeline

This is not a list of laws.

Each era answers five questions:

1. **What problems dominated the period**
2. **What the legislature actually did**
3. **Who gained power**
4. **Who lost power**
5. **What lesson carried forward**

Read it as a sequence of adaptations — not progress.
