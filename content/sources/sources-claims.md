# Claims and Evidence

This archive is built around **claims**, not assumptions.

A claim is a specific, testable assertion about:
- what happened,
- who acted,
- what authority was exercised,
- or what impact occurred.

---

## How Claims Work

Each claim in the archive:
- is written in clear language,
- is linked to one or more sources,
- includes date context,
- and may include confidence notes.

Claims are the atomic unit of historical accountability.

## Examples of Claims

- “The Arkansas Constitution of 1874 weakened executive authority.”
- “Black male suffrage was expanded under the 1868 Constitution.”
- “Procedural barriers increased for citizen initiatives after 2000.”

Each of these claims must be supported by evidence.

## Claims vs. Interpretation

- **Claims** describe what can be shown.
- **Interpretations** explain meaning or consequence.

Interpretations are labeled as such and linked to the claims they rely on.

---

## Why This Matters

Claims-based structure allows:
- disagreement without erasure,
- revision without rewriting history,
- and analysis without distortion.

Readers can trace conclusions back to evidence.
