\# Sources & Provenance

This archive is built on evidence.

Every historical claim, interpretation, and analytical conclusion is grounded in sources that are:

\- identifiable,

\- traceable,

\- and open to scrutiny.

This section explains \*\*how information enters the archive\*\*, how it is evaluated, and how uncertainty or disagreement is handled.

Transparency is not optional.

It is the foundation of public trust.

\## What Counts as a Source

We draw from multiple categories of evidence, including:

\- constitutional texts and amendments,

\- legislative records,

\- court opinions and filings,

\- executive orders and administrative rules,

\- election returns and official reports,

\- historical newspapers and archives,

\- academic research,

\- and documented community records.

Each source is cataloged and preserved as part of the historical record.
