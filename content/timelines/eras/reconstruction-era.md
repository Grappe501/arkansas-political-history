\# Reconstruction & Federal Intervention

\### Era Overview

This era marks the most significant restructuring of political power in Arkansas history. Following the Civil War, federal authority intervened directly to redefine citizenship, voting rights, and governance.

Change during this period did not emerge organically from state leadership. It was enforced through federal law and military presence.
