# Community Impact

Political history does not live only in capitol buildings.

It lives in:
- schools that were funded or defunded,
- neighborhoods that were annexed or ignored,
- jobs that disappeared or never arrived,
- water that was protected or polluted,
- and voices that were amplified or silenced.

This section documents how political decisions in Arkansas have shaped communities across time and place.

## What We Mean by “Community”

In this archive, a community may be defined by:
- geography (county, city, neighborhood, school district),
- identity (race, class, labor sector),
- or shared impact (students, workers, farmers, incarcerated people).

Communities overlap.
Their experiences are not uniform.

## How This Section Works

Community Impact pages connect:
- **decisions** (constitutions, laws, court rulings),
- **structures** (rules, districts, enforcement),
- **outcomes** (measurable and lived).

Each page focuses on **patterns**, not isolated incidents.
