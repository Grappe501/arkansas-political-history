# County Faith + Politics Overlays  
## How Belief Institutions Shaped Local Power

---

## Start Here: Churches Are County Infrastructure

In Arkansas, churches function as more than places of worship.

In many counties, churches have been:
- the earliest durable institutions after settlement,
- the most consistent leadership pipelines,
- the primary community messaging network,
- a moral authority that grants legitimacy to power,
- and, at key moments, the organizing engine for resistance.

County politics cannot be understood without county faith infrastructure.

This overlay system makes that visible.

## What an “Overlay” Is in This Project

An overlay is a county-specific module that sits on top of:
- county formation history,
- constitutional eras,
- legislative behavior,
- court geography,
- and Direct Democracy battles.

It answers a single question:

> How did faith institutions shape who governed here, and how did power travel through the county?

These overlays are not denominational encyclopedias.
They are political history by institutional network.

## How to Use This Index

You can enter this system in three ways:

1. **Pick a county**  
   Read how faith networks shaped its politics over time.

2. **Compare counties**  
   See why political behavior differs across the Delta, Ozarks, and urban corridors.

3. **Cross-link to state-level spines**  
   Use each county overlay to connect local reality to constitutions, amendments, and legislative eras.

## The Contract: What Every County Overlay Must Contain

Each county overlay page must include:

### 1) County Church Geography
- early settlement religious footprint
- major denominational presence by era
- church density patterns (if known)
- ties to transportation routes and town formation

### 2) Denominational Timeline (Plain-Language)
A chronological narrative that answers:
- what denominations arrived first,
- what grew fastest and why,
- what institutions (schools, missions, media) formed,
- what splits or realignments mattered.

### 3) Faith and Political Power Interaction
A narrative showing:
- how churches supported or resisted local power,
- how race and class shaped congregational structures,
- how ministers and lay leadership entered civic roles,
- how church networks affected elections, policy fights, or reforms.

### 4) State-Level Alignment Links
Each overlay must explicitly connect to:
- constitutional eras (1836 / 1874 / Amendment Era)
- legislative eras (by time period)
- judiciary geography (where legal disputes flowed)
- Direct Democracy mobilization or suppression (where relevant)

### 5) Named Institutions and “Organizing Infrastructure”
Not just denominations — institutions:
- prominent churches and associations (when known)
- church-founded schools or colleges
- denominational governance bodies
- media channels (radio, print, social)
- civic coalitions rooted in churches (when known)

This is what turns history into a usable map.

## Framework Integration (Cross-Link Rules)

Each county overlay should list frameworks when clearly present:

- **Legitimacy Laundering** (faith used to authorize power without redistribution)
- **Institutional Memory as Power** (church networks outlasting political turnovers)
- **Elite Continuity Through Turnover** (church-adjacent networks preserving influence)
- **Procedural Supremacy** (faith mobilization shaping process fights, not just policy fights)

Framework references must link back to the framework pages where possible:
- /frameworks/index
- /frameworks/patterns/...

---

## County Overlay Navigation

This index will grow into a county list with links as overlays are created.

For now, the build rule is simple:

- County overlay slugs should follow:
  - `/community-impact/counties/<county-slug>/faith-politics`

Example:
- `/community-impact/counties/phillips/faith-politics`

## Build Notes: Why We’re Doing This

This overlay system teaches a core Arkansas power lesson:

> Durable power travels through durable institutions.

Church networks are durable:
- they create identity,
- train leaders,
- distribute narratives,
- and persist through political regime changes.

This is not about labeling churches as “good” or “bad.”

It is about treating faith institutions as what they have often been in Arkansas:

> one of the state’s most consistent organizing machines.
