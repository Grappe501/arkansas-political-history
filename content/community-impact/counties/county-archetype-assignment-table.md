# Arkansas County Archetype Assignment Table  
## How Each County Functions in the System

## How to Read This Table

Each county is assigned a **primary archetype** based on its *dominant historical and institutional role*.

Some counties also carry **secondary functions**, but no county performs all roles equally.

**Archetypes:**
- **Impact** — absorbs harm, generates pressure, limited procedural power  
- **Enforcement** — applies coercion, hosts prisons or heavy policing  
- **Decision** — controls courts, procedure, administrative authority  
- **Legitimacy** — supplies leadership, ideology, normalization  

This table is **functional**, not moral.

## What the Table Reveals

- **Decision power** is highly concentrated  
- **Enforcement** is geographically isolated  
- **Legitimacy** clusters around growth corridors and institutions  

This imbalance is not accidental.
