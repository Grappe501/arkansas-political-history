\# Policy Areas

Policy areas group decisions by \*\*what aspect of life they affect\*\*, not by who proposed them.

These pages document how governance decisions in Arkansas have shaped:

\- participation,

\- opportunity,

\- security,

\- and quality of life.

Each policy area page includes:

\- a clear definition,

\- historical foundations,

\- recurring power mechanisms,

\- and links to constitutions, events, and community impacts.

Policy areas are analytical tools â€" not advocacy platforms.
