# Decision: Initialize the Brain of the Build

## Date
2025-03-26

## Context
The project’s scope and longevity require a durable system for preserving decisions, reasoning, and evolving understanding.

## Decision
Create a versioned, markdown-based “Brain of the Build” that serves as the authoritative memory of the project.

## Alternatives Considered
- Wiki-style documentation (rejected due to overwrite risk)
- Single evolving design document (rejected due to loss of historical context)

## Consequences
- Increased documentation overhead.
- Strong protection against drift, revisionism, and loss of context.
- Enables seamless onboarding and long-term stewardship.

## Revisit Conditions
Only if a demonstrably superior additive memory system emerges.
