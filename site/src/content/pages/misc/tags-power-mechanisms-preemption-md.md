\# Preemption

\## Definition

Preemption occurs when a higher level of government restricts or overrides the authority of lower levels to act.

---

\## Why It Matters

Preemption centralizes power while preserving the appearance of local governance.

It often:

\- blocks community-led solutions,

\- standardizes outcomes regardless of local conditions,

\- and shifts accountability upward.

---

\## Arkansas Context

In Arkansas, preemption has been used to:

\- limit municipal authority,

\- restrict local labor and civil rights protections,

\- consolidate legislative power.

Preemption is frequently justified as uniformity or efficiency.
