\# Non-Negotiables â€" Arkansas Political History Project

\## 1. Evidence Over Narrative

No assertion enters the system without a source. Interpretations are allowed, but must be clearly labeled and grounded in evidence.

\## 2. Additive History, Not Replacement

Nothing is deleted. New information may supersede earlier understanding, but prior records remain intact and accessible.

\## 3. Transparency of Uncertainty

Conflicting accounts, gaps in records, and ambiguous evidence must be documentedâ€"not smoothed over.

\## 4. Separation of Fact and Analysis

Primary facts, interpretive analysis, and opinionated conclusions must be structurally distinguishable.

\## 5. Power Is a First-Class Concept

The system must explicitly track how power operatesâ€"through rules, money, institutions, courts, geography, and narrative.

\## 6. Community Impact Matters

Political history is incomplete without documenting its effects on real communities, especially those historically marginalized.

\## 7. Modular and Indefinite Growth

No design decision may artificially cap the scope or lifespan of the project.

\## 8. Public Accountability

This project exists to serve the public record and public understanding, not partisan convenience.

\## 9. Source Preservation

Original documents, where legally permissible, should be preserved alongside extracted data.

\## 10. Intellectual Honesty

Contradictions, mistakes, and revisions must be acknowledged openly and logged.
