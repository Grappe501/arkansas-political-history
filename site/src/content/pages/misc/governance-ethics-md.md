\# Ethics & Conflicts of Interest

Trust depends on ethical clarity.

---

\## Disclosure

Contributors and stewards must disclose:

\- financial interests,

\- organizational affiliations,

\- or personal involvement relevant to content.

Disclosures are noted internally and, when relevant, publicly.

---

\## Separation from Advocacy

Stand Up Arkansas engages in civic advocacy.

This archive is a \*\*historical and analytical record\*\*.

Advocacy goals do not determine:

\- inclusion of evidence,

\- interpretation of facts,

\- or suppression of uncomfortable history.

---

\## Respect for Communities

Community records are handled with care.

Lived experience is contextualized, not exploited.

---

\## Accountability

Ethical violations result in:

\- review,

\- correction,

\- or removal from contributor roles.
