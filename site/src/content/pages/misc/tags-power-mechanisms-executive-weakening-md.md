\# Executive Weakening

\## Definition

Executive weakening refers to the deliberate reduction of executive authority to limit enforcement and accountability.

---

\## Why It Matters

A weak executive:

\- limits policy enforcement,

\- fragments responsibility,

\- and shields the legislature from oversight.

---

\## Arkansas Context

The Arkansas Constitution of 1874:

\- reduced gubernatorial power,

\- fragmented executive offices,

\- and constrained enforcement authority.

This design remains influential today.
