\# Core Principles â€" Arkansas Political History Project

\## 1. History as Infrastructure

Political history is not background context; it is operational infrastructure for democracy.

\## 2. Claims-Based Knowledge

The system is built around verifiable claims linked to sources, not unexamined facts.

\## 3. Time Matters

Dates, sequences, and causality are essential. Events must be understood within their temporal context.

\## 4. Power Is Relational

Power is expressed through relationships between people, institutions, rules, and resources.

\## 5. Geography Is Political

Boundaries, districts, annexations, and jurisdictions shape representation and power.

\## 6. Institutions Remember Differently Than People

Official records and lived experiences may diverge; both deserve space.

\## 7. Tools Should Teach

Every interface and output should increase civic understanding, not obscure it.

\## 8. Design for Auditability

A future researcher must be able to reconstruct how any conclusion was reached.

\## 9. Resist Simplification

Complexity should be managed, not erased.

\## 10. Build for the Long View

This project is measured in decades, not sessions or election cycles.
