\# Disagreement & Dispute Resolution

Disagreement is expected in serious historical work.

This archive treats disagreement as a signal â€" not a threat.

\## How Disputes Are Handled

2\. Document competing interpretations.

3\. Link each interpretation to its sources.

4\. Label interpretations clearly.

5\. Preserve unresolved disagreement when necessary.
