\# Elections & Representation

\## Definition

This policy area covers laws and practices that determine:

\- who can vote,

\- how votes are counted,

\- how representation is structured,

\- and how political power is allocated.

---

\## Why It Matters

Elections and representation define who governs.

Small procedural choices can:

\- expand participation,

\- dilute voting power,

\- or insulate decision-makers from accountability.
