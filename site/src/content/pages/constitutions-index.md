\# The Arkansas Constitutions

Arkansas has not had one constitution, but several â€” each reflecting the political conditions, power struggles, and exclusions of its time.

These documents are not merely legal texts.

They are records of who was allowed to govern, who was excluded, and how authority was enforced.

This section documents each constitution as a \*\*power architecture\*\*, linking historical context to long-term consequences.

\## Constitutional Arc

\### Territorial Governance (1803â€“1836)

Federal control, appointed authority, and exclusion as the norm.

\### Constitution of 1836

An elite republic built on land ownership, slavery, and legislative dominance.

\### Constitution of 1861

A continuity document used to legitimize secession and preserve hierarchy.

\### Constitution of 1864

A wartime bridge under Union occupation â€” abolition without equality.

\### Constitution of 1868

Reconstruction imposed by federal authority, expanding suffrage and executive power.

\### Constitution of 1874

A structural counter-revolution designed to entrench elite control and resist reform.

\*This constitution remains in force today.\*

\### Amendment Era (1874â€“Present)

Change constrained through procedure, litigation, and gatekeeping.
