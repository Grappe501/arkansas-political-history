# Where Power Hides in the Legislative Process

The most important legislative decisions are often invisible.

They occur where discretion exists.

---

## Committee Chairs

Committee chairs control:
- agendas,
- hearing schedules,
- and amendment flow.

Chair power is rarely voted on by the public.

---

## Calendars and Timing

- Bills scheduled late may run out of time.
- Strategic delays avoid public accountability.

Timing is power.

---

## Rules Committees and Leadership

Leadership structures:
- decide priorities,
- manage conflict,
- and protect incumbents.

Procedural rules are enforceable power.

---

## Informal Norms

Not all power is written down.

Norms determine:
- which bills “deserve” hearings,
- whose testimony matters,
- and how dissent is handled.

---

## Why This Matters

Formal equality in lawmaking does not equal functional equality.

Understanding gatekeeping explains why some voices are never heard.
