\# Types of Sources

Not all sources carry the same function or weight.

This archive categorizes sources to clarify:

\- what kind of evidence is being used,

\- how it should be interpreted,

\- and where its limitations lie.

---

\## Primary Sources

Primary sources are contemporaneous records created at the time of an event or decision.

Examples include:

\- constitutional texts

\- legislative journals

\- court opinions

\- executive orders

\- official election returns

\- government correspondence

Primary sources are foundational, but not infallible.

---

\## Secondary Sources

Secondary sources analyze, interpret, or contextualize primary records.

Examples include:

\- academic research

\- historical analyses

\- investigative journalism

\- official reports written after the fact

Secondary sources are essential for understanding context and consequence.

---

\## Tertiary Sources

Tertiary sources summarize or compile existing material.

Examples include:

\- encyclopedias

\- reference databases

\- educational summaries

These sources are useful for orientation but are not treated as authoritative without corroboration.

---

\## Community and Oral Sources

Community records, oral histories, and lived experience may be included when:

\- primary documentation is absent or incomplete,

\- institutional records erase or distort impact,

\- and the source is clearly identified as such.

These sources are labeled explicitly and contextualized carefully.

---

\## Why Categorization Matters

Understanding what a source is helps readers understand:

\- what it can prove,

\- what it can suggest,

\- and where caution is required.
