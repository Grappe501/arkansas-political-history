\# Evidence Standards

This archive applies consistent standards to all content, regardless of political implication.

---

\## Minimum Standards

To be included:

\- sources must be identifiable,

\- claims must be specific,

\- and context must be provided.

---

\## Corroboration

Where possible:

\- claims are supported by multiple sources,

\- especially when consequences are significant.

Single-source claims are labeled accordingly.

---

\## Transparency Over Authority

Institutional authority does not substitute for evidence.

Official records are documented â€" and questioned when appropriate.

---

\## Why This Matters

Standards protect the archive from:

\- propaganda,

\- selective memory,

\- and narrative manipulation.

They protect readers from us.
