\# Conflicting Accounts & Uncertainty

History is not always clean.

Records may:

\- conflict,

\- be incomplete,

\- or reflect the bias of those who created them.

This archive does not resolve uncertainty by hiding it.

---

\## How Conflicts Are Handled

When sources conflict:

\- multiple accounts are documented,

\- differences are explained,

\- and no single narrative is imposed without justification.

Conflicts are treated as data, not defects.

---

\## Gaps in the Record

Absence of evidence is itself meaningful.

When records are missing, destroyed, or never created:

\- that absence is noted,

\- likely reasons are discussed,

\- and claims are limited accordingly.

---

\## Bias and Power

Many historical records reflect the perspective of those in power.

This archive explicitly asks:

\- who created the record,

\- for what purpose,

\- and who was excluded from authorship.

---

\## Why This Matters

Honest uncertainty strengthens credibility.
