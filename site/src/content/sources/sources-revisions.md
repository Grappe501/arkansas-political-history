\# Revisions and Updates

This archive is a living system.

New evidence, analysis, or context may:

\- refine existing claims,

\- challenge earlier interpretations,

\- or expand understanding.

---

\## Additive Updates

Nothing is silently overwritten.

Revisions:

\- reference prior versions,

\- explain what changed,

\- and preserve earlier understanding.

This creates a visible intellectual history of the archive itself.

---

\## Version Indicators

Pages may include:

\- version numbers,

\- last updated dates,

\- and update notes.

Readers can see how understanding evolves over time.

---

\## Accountability

Errors are acknowledged, not erased.

This archive values correction over perfection.
