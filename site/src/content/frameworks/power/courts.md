\# Courts as Power Referees

Courts in Arkansas do not merely interpret law.

They shape political outcomes by:

\- deciding timing,

\- setting standards,

\- and determining enforceability.

---

\## Interpretation as Power

Legal language is often broad.

Courts decide:

\- how strictly rules are applied,

\- whose claims are valid,

\- and when remedies are available.

Delay can function as denial.

---

\## Judicial Selection and Accountability

Elected or appointed judges:

\- reflect political currents,

\- face institutional pressures,

\- and operate within constitutional constraints.

Judicial independence exists within structure.

---

\## Why This Matters

When courts become the final gatekeepers of reform, access to justice becomes access to power.
