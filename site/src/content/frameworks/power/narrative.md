\# Narrative and Legitimacy

Power requires consent â€" or at least acceptance.

Narratives shape:

\- what feels normal,

\- what feels dangerous,

\- and what feels impossible.

---

\## Legitimizing Authority

Stories about:

\- tradition,

\- local control,

\- and stability

often serve to justify existing arrangements.

---

\## Framing Change

Reform is frequently framed as:

\- risky,

\- radical,

\- or externally imposed.

Narrative can delegitimize participation without banning it.

---

\## Why This Matters

Understanding power requires listening not just to laws, but to the stories told about them.

Narrative determines what people believe is possible.
