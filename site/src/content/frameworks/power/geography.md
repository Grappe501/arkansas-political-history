\# Geography as Power

Where lines are drawn determines who is represented.

Geography shapes:

\- electoral outcomes,

\- resource distribution,

\- and political attention.

---

\## Districts and Boundaries

At-large systems, district maps, and annexations can:

\- dilute votes,

\- consolidate power,

\- or protect incumbents.

These choices are political, not neutral.

---

\## Urban vs. Rural Dynamics

Representation often favors:

\- land over population,

\- established interests over growth,

\- incumbency over responsiveness.

Geographic power persists even as demographics change.

---

\## Why This Matters

Representation is not just about numbers.

It is about \*\*design\*\*.
