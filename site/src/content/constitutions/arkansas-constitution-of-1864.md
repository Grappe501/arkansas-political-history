\# Arkansas Constitution of 1864 (Unionist Wartime Constitution)

\## Context

The Arkansas Constitution of 1864 was adopted under Union military occupation during the Civil War. It represents an attempt to restore civil government in Arkansas while the war was still ongoing and while Confederate authority had not fully collapsed statewide.

This constitution exists in a state of contested legitimacy:

\- It was not recognized by Confederate authorities.

\- It operated under federal military protection.

\- It did not emerge from universal democratic participation.

Rather than marking a clean restoration of democracy, the 1864 Constitution reflects \*\*conditional reintegration\*\* into the United States under federal supervision.

---

\## Political Conditions at Adoption

\- Large portions of Arkansas were under Union control.

\- Confederate state government continued to claim authority elsewhere.

\- Federal officials sought a loyal civil government to stabilize the region.

\- Voter participation was sharply limited.

The constitution was part of a broader Union strategy to reassert authority without fully resolving questions of citizenship and racial equality.

---

\## Who Participated

\- White Unionist Arkansans.

\- Former Confederates who took loyalty oaths.

\- Federal military authorities exerted significant influence.

\### Who Was Excluded

\- Enslaved people (despite emancipation momentum).

\- Free Black Arkansans from political participation.

\- Many white Arkansans displaced or disenfranchised by war.

---

\## Core Features

\### Abolition of Slavery

\- Slavery was formally abolished.

\- This aligned Arkansas law with federal wartime policy.

However, abolition did not equate to political equality or protection.

---

\### Government Structure

\- Bicameral legislature retained.

\- Governor and executive authority restored under Union alignment.

\- Judiciary reestablished under federal protection.

---

\### Voting and Citizenship

\- Voting rights restricted primarily to white males.

\- Loyalty oaths required.

\- No guarantee of Black suffrage or civil rights.

The constitution ended slavery but preserved racial political exclusion.

---

\## Power Analysis

The 1864 Constitution represents:

\- Federal leverage without full transformation.

\- Elite adaptation to new power realities.

\- An attempt to stabilize governance while deferring racial justice.

It restored state institutions while leaving core power hierarchies largely intact.

---

\## Parallel Legitimacy Problem

At the time:

\- Confederate-aligned governance claimed legitimacy in some regions.

\- The 1864 government was recognized by the Union.

\- Many Arkansans recognized neither as legitimate.

This fractured legitimacy weakened long-term stability.

---

\## Practical Governance

\- Elections occurred under military oversight.

\- Courts functioned unevenly.

\- Enforcement of rights depended heavily on federal presence.

The constitution functioned more as an \*\*administrative bridge\*\* than a durable framework.

---

\## Long-Term Impact

\- Established abolition as non-negotiable.

\- Failed to secure political rights for formerly enslaved people.

\- Set the stage for the more radical Reconstruction Constitution of 1868.

The 1864 Constitution illustrates the limits of moderate reform in the absence of structural power shifts.
