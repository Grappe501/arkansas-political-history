# Decision: Establish Arkansas Political Eras Framework

## Date
2025-03-27

## Context
A comprehensive historical system requires consistent temporal organization to avoid fragmentation and ahistorical comparisons.

## Decision
Define a set of Arkansas political eras based on shifts in power, governance, and institutional structure.

## Alternatives Considered
- Strict decade-based chronology (rejected)
- Election-cycle-only framing (rejected)

## Consequences
- Enables structured analysis and cross-era comparison.
- Requires ongoing scholarly humility and revision.

## Revisit Conditions
If evidence shows major power shifts that warrant reclassification.
