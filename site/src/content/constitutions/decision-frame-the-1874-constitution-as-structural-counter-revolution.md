\# Decision: Frame the 1874 Constitution as Structural Counter-Revolution

\## Date

2025-04-01

\## Context

The 1874 Constitution replaced the Reconstruction framework and remains Arkansasâ€™ governing document.

\## Decision

Analyze the 1874 Constitution as a deliberate counter-revolution designed to entrench elite control and resist reform.

\## Alternatives Considered

\- Treat as neutral modernization (rejected)

\- Treat as purely reactionary rhetoric (rejected)

\## Consequences

\- Provides explanatory power for modern legislative dominance.

\- Grounds contemporary reform debates in historical structure.

\## Revisit Conditions

Only if evidence suggests reform intent outweighed power-entrenchment goals.
