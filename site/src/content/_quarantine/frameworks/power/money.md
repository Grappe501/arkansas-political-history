\# Money and Influence

Money does not simply support political outcomes â€" it \*\*structures possibility\*\*.

In Arkansas, economic power often determines:

\- who runs for office,

\- who can sustain advocacy,

\- and whose interests receive attention.

\## Campaign Finance

Campaign funding affects:

\- candidate viability,

\- issue prioritization,

\- and legislative behavior.

Even when legal, financial imbalance shapes access.

\## Contracts and Economic Dependence

\- create incentives for compliance,

\- reward aligned interests,

\- and discourage dissent.

Economic reliance becomes political leverage.

\## Why This Matters

Money rarely dictates votes directly.

It influences:

\- who is present in the room,

\- which voices are heard,

\- and which risks are acceptable.
